# Noam
Noam is a small programming language which is created for studying compilers and interpreters. To simplify things I wanted an interpreted language with dynamic typing that would mostly used as a scripting tool in a custom game engine.

At the moment there is no documented or formally written grammar of the language. All the features and constructions are considered by means of purpose.

## Features

List of currently supported features:

- Integer literal

- Floating point number literal

- String literal

- Boolean literal

- Basic math operations with implicit type cast: +, -, *, /

- String concatenation

- Nested expressions

- Variable assignment

- Function definition

- Function call

- Print function

- Comments

  

- [ ] If else statement
- [ ] Loops
- [ ] Package imports
- [ ] Full-pack of operators: +=, -=, ==, !=, etc
